VGA2USB Driver for Linux
------------------------


Overview
--------

This package contains source code and binary modules required to build
the driver.  Proprietary and closed source part of the driver provided
in form of precompiled object files. During the build process open
source part will be compiled and linked with the proprietary code to
form loadable kernel module.


Requirements
------------

Kernel:
2.6.x and 3.x kernels are supported.
In order to successfully load module kernel should include support for
USB 2.0.

Kernel source tree:
To successfully compile the driver, kernel source tree has to be
installed and configured to match currently running kernel.

Compilation
-----------

Before compiling kernel verify or change the following:
1) For Redhat and Fedora Core 1 kernels uncomment KMARKER definition in the
   Config.mak
2) Verify path to the kernel source tree in Config.mak


Usage
-----

To load the driver run 'make load' command.
If you want to put the driver module into the standard module directory run
'sudo make install' command.

Following device nodes are created:
/dev/videoX   - Video4Linux/V4L2 interface

/dev/vga2usbX - Epiphan proprietary interface. Provides full control
                over framegrabber when used with Epiphan frame grabber
                SDK
                http://www.epiphan.com/products/frame-grabbers/vga2usb/development/

/dev/epiphanaudioX - interface for controlling audio capture. (Only for devices
                which support audio capture.)


Please note that the driver has several parameters that can be specified at
module load time. To list driver parameters run 'modinfo ./vga2usb.ko' command.
Please pay attention to parameters that have "_enable" as part of their name:
default values may not be suitable for your situation, in particular you may
have to explicitly enable V4L2 support, for example:
sudo insmod ./vga2usb.ko v4l2_enable=1

You can try the following V4L applications

mplayer -tv device=/dev/video0 tv://

vlc v4l2:///dev/video0

mencoder \
        -oac lavc \
        -ovc lavc \
        -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:keyint=100:vbitrate=8000:vhq \
        -noaspect -flip \
        -o test.avi \
        -tv noaudio:driver=v4l2:outfmt=bgr24:device=/dev/video0 \
        tv://

Replace /dev/video0 with appropriate device node if applicable.
Use "v4l" instead of "v4l2" if applicable.
